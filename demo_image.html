           <p>"ROSE" is the eighth and final single by the Japanese visual rock band Versailles. It was released on July 4, 2012, to commemorate the band's fifth anniversary. [2] The single is available in two versions: a "regular edition" and a "6,666-piece limited edition." [3][4] As the name suggests, only 6,666 copies of the limited edition were released, each with a serial number on the back. This edition includes four tracks, including a re-written Japanese version of "Love will be born again" (the original song was in English) and a re-recording of "THE RED CARPET DAY," which was from the band's debut mini-album "Lyrical Sympathy." The limited edition includes a 52-page deluxe photo book and a DVD, which includes an introduction to Versailles' career since the band was formed, as well as a video from February 2012.</p>
